Use this file to explain how your sploit5 works.

Target5 uses snprintf and allows us to insert out own string formats.

1. To start, we create a buffer where the first 4 bytes are the address 
   of the eip offset by one byte.
2. The remainder of 480 bytes of the buffer can be filled with nop sled 
   (430 bytes) and 45 bytes of shellcode.
3. At this point the buffer is full and since it is size guarded
   no more data can be written to it. However, it will continue 
   to print the remaining characters even if they do not go into
   the buffer.

   When we insert string formatting arguments the print looks for
   extra arguments input to the function. Sicne no extra args are input
   it will read data from the stack. First we use %d twice this increments
   the argument pointer. Then we do %12582420d - this increments the argument
   pointer a third time while also printing 12582420 spaces. Now, the argument
   pointer points to the beginning of the buffer. The last argument is %n. %n 
   will take the address (addr of eip offset by one byte) at the beggining of 
   the buffer and write the number of bytes printed at the address. At this
   point we have printed ~12582420 bytes which gives 0xbffffb. Now the eip 
   points to the nop sled in the buffer.
