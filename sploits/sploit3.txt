Use this file to explain how your sploit3 works.

In sploit 3 I can input a custom size for my argument.
One mistake is that this custom size is cast to a signed integer.
This means that I can input a negative number and it will bypass
the size guard. However, not any negative number will do as once
it is interpreted as an unsiged int in memcpy the number will be 
very large causing a segfault. The negative number -2147483482
will both bypass the size guard and when multiplied by the 
sizeof(widget_t) will overflow and yield a small number 2656. My
target buffer is 2640 bytes. Following the size input, this gives 
room for 2595 nop sled bytes, 45 bytes of shellcode, followed by 
16 bytes of the eip which will point to the nop sled at 0xbfffed90.
