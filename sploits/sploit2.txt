Use this file to explain how your sploit2 works.

Target2 accepts a buffer of 200 bytes, however, the strcpy
is length guarded. One mistake is that the for loop end 
condition is <=, normally this would be acceptable assuming
a string that is smaller than the buffer and null terminated.
In the event of a string the size of 200 though, this will cause
the function to write to the 200th index or the 201st byte.
I use this to zero out the least significant byte of the saved ebp
in bar(). When bar returns to foo it restores the ebp to this new address 
inside the buf. When foo returns it resotres the saved eip in relation
to $ebp. Since $ebp is in the buffer we can fill the buffer with
our desired eip. The eip 0xbffffd4f fills the first half of the buffer
that points to the next 1/4 which is nop sled and the final 1/4th is the
shell code. The last byte is just 0x00 which is the one that overwrites
the ebp.
