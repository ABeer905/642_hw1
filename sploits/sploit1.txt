Use this file to explain how your sploit1 works.

Target1 accepts a buffer of 180 bytes.
Since the shellcode provided is 45 bytes I filled
the input with 180-45 = 135 bytes of nop sled \x90.
The next 45 bytes are the shellcode. Lastly, I use 
8 bytes to overwrite the EBP/EIP with 0xBFFFFD40. This hex
code is the location of the buffer in memory + 60 bytes.
I added 60 bytes to be near the middle of the nop sled to
account for the stack shifting.
